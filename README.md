# Limiter
If certain conditions are met—such as reaching a set number of keystrokes or mouse scrolls, or exceeding a time limit for app usage—Limiter will automatically close distracting apps to ensure you stay on track. Perfect for anyone looking to reduce distractions and enhance focus while working or studying.
